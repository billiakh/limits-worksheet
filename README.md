A mini limits worksheet.

## How to help

Don't know Git, or Latex? Don't worry, start an issue with the desired questions and answers, and I'll incorporate them into the project.

### Pointers for new questions!
* The questions should not be very trivial.
* All the questions, except the ones which are to be answered in theory, should accompany an answer.
* PLEASE follow the writing-style IF you're sending pull requests, see Documentation below.

## Documentation

### The questions environment
The questions environment is a really basic environment which just consists of a labelled ordered list, in which questions could be added with `\q` and answers with `\a{answer-text}`.

### The `\abs` command
The `\abs` command is 'inverted', the starred-command would be called when the non-starred version is used, and vice versa.
